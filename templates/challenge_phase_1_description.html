This validation phase is used for model hyper-parameter tunning. Users are allowed to evaluate their model on this split for many times. Also, as validation data is released, users can use our provided evaluation script to run their evaluation locally. However, we highly encourage users to report their validation performance in this leaderboard as well so that others can easily compare with using the same evaluation protocol.
