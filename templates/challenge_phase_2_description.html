This test phase is used to rank methods with fair comparison. Winners of the challenge will be determined by the ranking on this phase. We do not release annotation file of this split to users and users are only allowed to use the validation phase for model parameter tunning. As the number of submission in the test phase is limited, participants should only submit to this phase with a large model update.
